This repository contains strategy modules and configuration files used by the [nb-runner](https://github.com/NeoMatrixAI/nb-runner) repository.

---

### üìÅ Structure

Each strategy is organized in its own folder and includes:
- `strategy_name.py`: The core logic of the strategy
- `strategy_name_config.py`: The configuration file for that strategy

Example:

```
strategy/{future/spot}
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ momentum_v1/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ momentum_v1.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ momentum_v1_config.py
```

This repository contains the strategies and configuration files we have developed and regularly update.  
No executable notebooks or API modules are included here.

However, you are free to use your own custom strategies and configuration files in the `nb-runner` environment,  
not limited to the ones provided in this repository.
